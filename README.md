# hello
Readme file of the project. 

Sample go runs 
Main program has the main method and calls the other methods as necessary. 
Hence the need to have go run command include all go files 

go run main.go mandel.go dbcall.go wc_series.go list

else gives error MainDb not found. 

the other option is to run go build, which will include all files in the executable.
